            <p>The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IES) is the recognized technical authority on illumination. The IES serves as a forum for the exchange of information and ideas as well as a vehicle for professional development and recognition. Through technical committees, research, investigations, and discussions, guidance is provided to the lighting professionals through consensus-based lighting recommendations. Its members work with lighting in a variety of capacities - lighting designers, architects, interior designers, government & utility personnel, engineers, contractors, manufacturers, distributors, researchers and educators - throughout the world. Together they share a common interest in lighting and a common desire to promote the use of the most innovating lighting technologies with a focus on judicious use of energy in all lighting applications.</p>
            <p>The Central of Iowa IES section's vision is to build upon a century of outstanding excellence to create a premier lighting community that's dedicated to promoting the art and science of lighting to its members, allied profession organizations and to the public. We continually strive to uphold these efforts through educational programs, presentations, and social networking events.</p>
